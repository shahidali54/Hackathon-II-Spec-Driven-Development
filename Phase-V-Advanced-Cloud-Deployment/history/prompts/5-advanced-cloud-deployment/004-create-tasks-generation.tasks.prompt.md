## Prompt

```

```

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks file for Phase V Advanced & Intermediate Features for AI-Powered Todo Chatbot. The tasks are organized by user story in priority order and follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The structure includes setup, foundational, and 8 user story phases, plus a polish phase. Each user story is designed to be independently implementable and testable.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete tasks file created with 100+ tasks organized by user story priority
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/5-advanced-cloud-deployment/tasks.md with proper structure and dependencies
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks follow the checklist format and are organized for independent story implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of tasks
